# Low-Light-Image-Restoration-Using-Resnet

This repository aims to improve the quality of images captured in low-light conditions, making them comparable to those captured in normal-light. With the growing demand for high- quality images and videos, this challenge is of immense importance in various fields, including surveillance, photography, and medical imaging. A novel method for low-light image restoration would have far-reaching implications, including improved safety, better diagnosis, and enhanced visual media.
